# Requirement 
1. Using React or Next JS as the framework
2. Use SCSS for the CSS styling
3. Use of components, e.g, the card should be made up of the following components, Card, CardImage, CardHeader, CardBody, Button.
4. It should be responsive, and look good on desktop and mobile, the cards should be in a single column on mobile.
5. Card 3 needs to have 2 paragraphs of text in it so it's higher than the other cards - looking to see how you handle different height cards here.
6. We are looking for attention to detail, padding, border radius, box shadow, overlays, alignment as per the design.
